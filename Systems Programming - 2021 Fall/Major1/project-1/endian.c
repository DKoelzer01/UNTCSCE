/*
	Instructions:
	This code will contain a single function (and the include directive 
	to your header file) to perform the endian swap operation of the 
	32-bit input argument passed to this function. Endianness refers to 
	how the bytes are stored in memory. In a 32-bit word, there are 4 
	bytes â€“ B0, B1, B2, and B3. Let us assume that B0 refers to the least 
	significant byte and B3 the most significant byte.
	The function will swap (exchange) bytes B0 and B3, as well as bytes 
	B1 and B2.
