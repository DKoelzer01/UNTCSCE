# Bonus
Bonus has been implemented.

# Compiling
Compile the program by running the provided MAKEFILE with the `make` command.
This will compile all `.cpp` files needed into one output file titled `contagion`

# Execution
Execute the program by running one of the following lines of code
`make run` or `./contagion`

`make run` will recompile the program if any changes are detected and immediately run the program after compilation is finished.

`./contagion` will run the already compiled program regardless of any changes since last compilation.
