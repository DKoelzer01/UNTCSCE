Description: Homework 2. Paintball game.

Create paintball game on a 10x10 (0-9,0-9) grid.
Place 1 enemy and 1 friendly.
Prompt the player to either Shoot or Search a location.
Shoot 	- Enemy - Friendly - None
		  Win	  Lose		 -1 try

Search 	- Enemy	- Friendly - None
		  Lose	  Try x2	 -1 try
		  
		  
Set constant "size" = 10
Pick 2 random spots using [rand()%10] for friendly and enemy X Y positions.
Implement logical check for player choice using outcomes above.

Using ANSI color codes for style / readability.
Syntax : 	\033 - ESC character 
			[ declares start of ANSI coding. 
			1st digit is format digit. Using 1 for Bold, 0 for reset formatting.
			;30 - ;37 correspond to different foreground colors.
			
Ex: \033[1;31mGame over!!!\033[0m
results in a string "Game over!!!" in bold red text.

Implement error and bounds checking regularly to insure proper execution.

**Check for cheating when searching for ally. Prevent player from getting infinite lives.**
